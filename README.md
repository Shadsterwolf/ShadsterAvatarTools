# Shadster's Avatar Tools [Download](https://github.com/Shadsterwolf/ShadsterAvatarTools/releases)
Shadsterwolf's own avatar tools, mostly used for personal use and subject to change. <br />
<b>Intended for Unity Editor to support VRChat Avatar models</b>
```diff
- Please note this is still under-developed and isn't very "user friendly"
- Backup at least a prefab of your avatar, use at your own risk!!!
- Theres missing feedback, but once the button is pressed the code executes. If the console shows no errors, it probably worked.
```
