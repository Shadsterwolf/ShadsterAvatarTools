Shadsterwolf's avatar tools, mostly used for personal use and subject to change. <br />
<b>Intended for Unity Editor to support VRChat Avatar models</b>
- Most Buttons will be hard changes done to your avatar, use at your own risk!!!
- Theres still missing debug/message feedback, but once the button is pressed the code executes. If the console shows no errors, it probably worked.

- Set Compression LQ/NQ/HQ - Set texture compression quality Low, Normal, High (Unity default is normal compression)

Bones:
- Move PhysBones from Armature - Moves physbones off Armature, assinging the source object, and to the parent object.
- Move Colliders from Aramature - Moves physbone colliders off Armature, assinging the source object, and to the parent object.

Animation: 
- Generate Animation Render Toggles - Find all meshes and generate animation files On/Off by game object, stored in "...\Animations\Generated\Toggles"
- Generate Animation Shapekeys - Find all meshes and their shapekeys, combine objects keys with the same name, generate animation files 0/100, stored in "...\Animations\Generated\Shapekeys". Any shapekeys with "Emote_" will be stored in "...\Animations\Generated\Emotes"
- Generate Animation Physbones - Generate some common physbone control settings
- Generate Emote Override Menu - Generate a menu with emotes with each emote inside "...\Animations\Generated\Emotes"

Gogo Loco:
- Setup Prefab - Copies "Beyond Prefab" to Avatar hierarchy and assigns constraint source to head
- Setup Layers - Updates Avatar Descriptor's Playable layers except FX and unchecks "Force Locomotion animations for 6 point tracking
- Setup Menu - Adds Gogo Loco menu to your main menu
- Setup Params - Adds Gogo's parameters to your VRC parameters (and deletes the old previous version ones too)
- Setup FX - Copies the two fly layers over to your current FX layer (adds the controller parameters too) 

Scene:
(Context - Usually "Assets/Avatar", labels the location that the buttons within Scene will influence)
- Setup Menus/Params - Copy off the VRCSDK3 sample menu and params to the folder, attaches to the avatar
- Setup FX Controller - Copy off the VRCSDK3 sample FX controller to the folder, attaches to the avatar
- Regenerate GUIDs - Creates a new folder with a 1 "Avatar1" re-writing new GUIDs (CAUTION, few reference IDs might be missed and will need to manaully be repointed)
- Cleanup - Reads every scene within context,  delete any leftover prefabs from this tool
- Fix - Applies all fixes within "Common" to all scenes and avatars with vrc descriptor
- Export - Exports everything in the context folder and Gogo Loco to a unitypackage file
