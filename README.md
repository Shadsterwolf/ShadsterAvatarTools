# Shadster's Avatar Tools [Download](https://github.com/Shadsterwolf/ShadsterAvatarTools/releases)
Shadsterwolf's own avatar tools, mostly used for personal use and subject to change. <br />
<b>Intended for Unity Editor to support VRChat Avatar models</b>
- Please note this is still under-developed and isn't very "user friendly"
- Backup at least a prefab of your avatar, use at your own risk!!!
- Theres missing feedback, but once the button is pressed the code executes. If the console shows no errors, it probably worked.


# Instructions
1. With a project open with VRCSDK (from VRChat Content Creator)
2. Import my provided released package
3. In Unity, on your toolbar, click "ShadsterWolf" > Show Avatar Tools

(Pro-tip, use Alt+S to bring up my tool menu, S again for Main tool window, G for Gogo Loco Setup, F for FX Setup)

# Features
- Quick Sceneview and Playmode speed up toggles
- Quick settings of mesh boundaries and anchor probes
- Quick setup for Gogo Loco (after import): https://franadavrc.gumroad.com/l/gogoloco
